# Step 0: Project Scaffolding.

# Goal

Create the foundational directory and file structure for the project as specified in the technical design document. This step involves creating empty files and directories only; no functional code or tests are implemented yet.

# Instructions

Create Root Directory: Assume you are operating within the project_root/ directory.

Create Core Directories:

Create the src/ directory.

Create the tests/ directory.

Populate src/ Directory:

Inside src/, create the following subdirectories:

services/

templates/

static/

Inside src/static/, create the following subdirectories:

css/

js/

Inside src/, create the following empty files (touch them):

__init__.py

app.py

config_loader.py

exceptions.py

models.py

Inside src/services/, create the following empty files:

__init__.py

validator.py

parser.py

context_detector.py

chunk_translator.py

llm_helper.py

reassembler.py

Inside src/templates/, create the empty file:

index.html

Inside src/static/css/, create the empty file:

style.css

Inside src/static/js/, create the empty file:

app.js

Populate tests/ Directory:

Inside tests/, create the following subdirectories:

automated/

manual/

Inside tests/automated/, create the following subdirectories:

unit/

integration/

Inside tests/automated/unit/, create the empty file:

__init__.py

Inside tests/automated/integration/, create the empty file:

__init__.py

Inside tests/manual/, create the following empty files:

test_cases.md

upload_script.py

(Note: Specific test files like test_validator.py will be created in later steps when the corresponding modules are implemented).

Create Root Files:

Inside project_root/, create the following empty files:

.env

requirements.txt

README.md

# Verification

Confirm that all specified directories and empty files exist with the correct names (snake_case.py for Python files) and locations as described above and matching the "Module Structure & File Organization" section in the technical design.

Ensure __init__.py files are present in src/, src/services/, tests/automated/unit/, and tests/automated/integration/ to mark them as Python packages.

No functional code needs to be verified at this stage.

No tests need to be written or executed for this step.
