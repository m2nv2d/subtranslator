**Task 5: Context Detection Logic (Mock Implementation)**

**Project Context**

This module is part of a system designed to process subtitle files (specifically in SRT format). The purpose of this `context_detector` module is to analyze the initial portion of the subtitle text and determine a high-level topic or theme, referred to as the "context". This context information will likely be used by other parts of the system, possibly to improve subsequent processing steps like translation. Your task is to implement the basic structure of this module, focusing *only* on a "mock" mode that returns a predefined context without any real analysis or external API calls.

**Prerequisites**

*   Ensure your development environment has the necessary libraries installed, including `tenacity`. Check the project's dependency management setup for how to add or verify libraries.
*   You will need to interact with data structures and exceptions defined in other parts of the project. Familiarize yourself with:
    *   `src/models.py`: Contains the definitions for `SubtitleBlock` (representing a single subtitle entry with index, timestamps, and content) and `Config` (holding application configuration like API keys and retry settings). Assume this file exists and defines these data classes.
    *   `src/exceptions.py`: Contains custom exception classes. You will specifically need `ContextDetectionError`. Assume this file exists and defines this exception.

**Subtask 1: Create File Structure and Imports**

Create the file `src/context_detector.py`. Add the necessary import statements at the top. You will need `List` and potentially `Any` from `typing`, the `tenacity` library, the `SubtitleBlock` and `Config` models from `src.models`, and the `ContextDetectionError` exception from `src.exceptions`.

**Subtask 2: Implement `detect_context` Function Signature and Mock Logic**

Define the primary function within this module. It must have the following exact signature, as expected by other parts of the system:

```python
def detect_context(
    sub: List[List[SubtitleBlock]],
    speed_mode: str,
    genai_client: Any, # Note: Client is passed but NOT used in mock
    config: models.Config # Note: Config is passed but NOT used in mock
) -> str:
```

Inside this function, implement the logic for the "mock" speed mode. Check if the `speed_mode` parameter is equal to the string `"mock"`. If it is, the function should immediately return a hardcoded, simple string indicating a mock context (e.g., `"Mock Context Detected"` or `"Sample Topic"`). This path should not perform any significant computation, access the `sub` data deeply, or use the `genai_client` or `config` parameters.

**Subtask 3: Add Placeholder for Real API Logic**

Add the logic for cases where `speed_mode` is *not* `"mock"` (e.g., it might be `"fast"` or `"normal"` according to the system design). For this task, **do not implement any real context detection logic or API calls here**. Instead, insert a clear placeholder. This placeholder should indicate that this execution path is not yet functional such as return a distinct string like `"Real context detection logic not implemented"`.

Make sure this placeholder branch acknowledges that a real implementation would typically involve using the passed `genai_client` to interact with an external AI service and would use retry settings from the `config` object (using `tenacity`). It should also be clear that the real implementation would need error handling and might raise `ContextDetectionError` if the API call fails after retries.

**Subtask 4: Create Manual Test Script**

Create a simple Python script inside the `tests/manual/` directory (e.g., `test_context_detector.py`). This script should serve as a basic way to run your `detect_context` function manually.

It has 2 arguments: a srt file and `speed_mode`. It call the appropriate branch of the `detect_context` function and print the result. If needed, it invoked gemini_helper.py to initialize the client and pass it to the `detect_context` function.
