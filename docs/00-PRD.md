# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Statement

Content creators, language learners, and international audiences frequently encounter subtitled video content that is not available in their preferred language. Manual subtitle translation is time-consuming, expensive, and often requires professional translation services. There is a need for an accessible, automated solution that can quickly translate subtitle files while maintaining timing accuracy and contextual relevance.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Content Creators**: YouTubers, independent filmmakers, and media producers who need to make their content accessible to international audiences
- **Language Learners**: Students and educators who want to study content in multiple languages for comparison and learning
- **Personal Users**: Individuals who want to translate subtitles for personal viewing or sharing

### Secondary Users
- **Small Media Companies**: Organizations that need cost-effective translation solutions for their content libraries
- **Accessibility Advocates**: Users who work to make content more accessible across language barriers

## Core Features

### Essential Features
- **SRT File Upload**: Accept standard SubRip (.srt) subtitle files up to 2MB in size
- **Multi-Language Translation**: Support translation to Vietnamese and French (configurable for additional languages)
- **AI-Powered Translation**: Leverage Google Gemini API for context-aware, intelligent translation
- **Context Detection**: Automatically detect content context (e.g., "cooking tutorial", "drama series") to improve translation accuracy
- **Chunked Processing**: Break large subtitle files into manageable chunks for efficient processing
- **Download Translated Files**: Provide translated SRT files with original timing preserved
- **Processing Speed Options**: 
  - Normal mode (high-quality translation)
  - Fast mode (faster processing with good quality)
  - Mock mode (testing/development purposes)

### Performance Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple subtitle chunks simultaneously for improved speed
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanism for failed translation attempts
- **Resource Management**: Configurable concurrency limits to prevent system overload
- **Progress Feedback**: Basic status updates during processing

### Quality Features
- **Timing Preservation**: Maintain exact subtitle timing from original file
- **Context-Aware Translation**: Use detected context to improve translation accuracy
- **Structured Output**: Ensure consistent, properly formatted SRT output
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with user-friendly messages
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation of file formats, sizes, and language selections

## User Journeys

### Primary User Journey: Basic Translation
1. User visits the web application
2. User selects an SRT subtitle file from their device
3. User chooses target language from available options (Vietnamese, French)
4. User selects processing speed (normal/fast/mock)
5. User clicks "Translate" to begin processing
6. System displays processing status
7. System automatically downloads translated SRT file upon completion
8. User can use the translated file with their video content

### Secondary User Journey: Error Recovery
1. User uploads an invalid file or selects unsupported language
2. System displays clear error message explaining the issue
3. User corrects the input based on feedback
4. User successfully completes translation process

### Administrative User Journey: Statistics Monitoring
1. Administrator accesses `/stats` endpoint
2. System returns current application statistics including:
   - Total files processed
   - Success/failure rates
   - Processing times
   - Individual file statistics

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- Translation accuracy maintains context and meaning
- Subtitle timing remains perfectly synchronized
- File format integrity preserved (valid SRT output)
- Error rates below 5% for valid inputs

### Performance Metrics
- Average processing time under 2 minutes for typical subtitle files
- System handles concurrent requests without degradation
- 99% uptime for translation service availability
- Successful processing of files up to 2MB in size

### User Experience Metrics
- Intuitive single-page interface requires no training
- Clear error messages guide users to successful completion
- Download process initiates automatically upon completion
- Support for common subtitle file formats (.srt)

## Technical Constraints

### Infrastructure Constraints
- Single-server deployment suitable for moderate usage
- No persistent data storage (stateless processing)
- Temporary file storage during processing only
- Console-based logging for monitoring

### API Constraints
- Dependent on Google Gemini API availability and rate limits
- API key required for non-mock translation modes
- Network connectivity required for AI translation features
- Configurable retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### Security Constraints
- File size limited to 2MB to prevent abuse
- Secure filename handling for uploaded files
- API keys stored in environment variables
- No user authentication or session management
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Out of Scope

### Excluded Features
- Support for subtitle formats other than SRT (e.g., VTT, ASS, SSA)
- User accounts, authentication, or persistent sessions
- Real-time translation progress bars or detailed status updates
- Batch processing of multiple files simultaneously
- Video preview or subtitle synchronization testing
- Advanced translation customization (tone, formality, etc.)
- Subtitle editing or manual correction capabilities

### Excluded Technical Features
- Database storage or persistent data
- Horizontal scaling or load balancing
- Advanced deployment strategies (containerization, CI/CD)
- Comprehensive monitoring or analytics dashboards
- Advanced security features (rate limiting, user tracking)
- Mobile application or API for third-party integration
